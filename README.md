# GauchoChat Modules

## Introduction

This repository is part of my work on the GauchoChat project at UCSB, an advanced conversational AI system. Due to constraints on sharing the entire project, this repository focuses exclusively on modules I developed independently. Each module demonstrates specific aspects of my contribution to the project, showcasing my skills in Python programming, API integration, and natural language processing.

## Disclaimer

Please note that this repository does not contain the entire GauchoChat project. I am sharing these modules because I solely developed them, and they represent a segment of my work on the project. The code and documentation here are provided to illustrate my personal contribution and technical skills.

## Modules

### [First Turn Module](/first_turn_module)

## Acknowledgements

I extend my gratitude to Professor Xifeng Yan, Doctor Weizhi Wang, and the UCSB GauchoChat team for their guidance and support throughout my involvement in this innovative project.
